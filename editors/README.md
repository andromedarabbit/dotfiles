## [Atom](https://atom.io)

### Plugins

From `atom-packages.txt` file, you can check which plugins are going to be installed:

```txt
AtomicChar
activate-power-mode
advanced-open-file
```

This `atom-packages.txt` file is generated by running `apm`, which is the command-line package manager for Atom:

```bash
apm list --bare --installed | cut -d @ -f1 > atom-packages.txt
```

 Just delete the line from the `atom-packages.txt` file if you find the plugin you do not want to install.

#### [`linter-markdown`](https://atom.io/packages/linter-markdown)

`linter-markdown` uses [`remark-lint`](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-lint) behind the scene and `remark-lint` can be customised by using `${HOME}/.remarkrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "lint": {
      "no-multiple-toplevel-headings": false,
      "no-duplicate-headings": false,
      "list-item-indent": false,
      "maximum-line-length": false,
      "no-html": false
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "commonmark": true,
    "gfm": true
  }
}
```

## [Vim](https://vim.org)

### Configurations

I am not a big fan of Vim and tring to keep its configuration as simple as possible. Most of the additional features come from [vim-galore](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore/blob/master/content/minimal-vimrc.vim):

```viml
" You want Vim, not vi. When Vim finds a vimrc, 'nocomptaible' is set anyway.
" We set it explicitely to make our position clear!
set nocompatible

filetype plugin indent on  " Load plugins according to detected filetype.
syntax on                  " Enable syntax highlighting.

set autoindent             " Indent according to previous line.
set expandtab              " Use spaces instead of tabs.
set softtabstop =4         " Tab key indents by 4 spaces.
set shiftwidth  =4         " >> indents by 4 spaces.
set shiftround             " >> indents to next multiple of 'shiftwidth'.
```

### Plugins

The following plugins and more are installed by default using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```viml
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
Plug 'kien/ctrlp.vim'
Plug 'bling/vim-airline'
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'
Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'

Plug 'scrooloose/syntastic'
Plug 'elzr/vim-json'
Plug 'plasticboy/vim-markdown'
Plug 'fatih/vim-go'
Plug 'ekalinin/dockerfile.vim'

Plug 'rhysd/committia.vim'
```

Just comment it out if you find the plugin you do not want to install.

### Tips

#### Comment out lines

Using 'tpope/vim-commentary':

* `gcc` to comment out a line (takes a count)
* `gc` in visual mode to comment out the selection
* `:7,17Commentary`
* `g/TODO/Commentary`

## [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)

**NeoVim** basically uses the same configurations with Vim. However, `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` is not a symbolic link to `~/.vimrc`. I have decided to leave them separate files because there are some differences between NeoVim and Vim. These differences might not a big deal but they can be in the future.

## [IdeaVim](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim)

**IdeaVim** is a Vim emulation plugin for IDEs based on the IntelliJ platform. All the configuration are read from `.vimrc` into `.ideavimrc`.

```viml
source ~/.vimrc
```

Some IntelliJ-specific keymaps are written also:

```viml
map \r :action ReformatCode<CR>
map \o :action OptimizeImports<CR>
```
